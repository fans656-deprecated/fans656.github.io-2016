What happens when the following C++ program is executed?
    
    void f() {}
    int main() { f(); }

Answer:
    
    # in caller
    call f  # push the return address (address of the instruction after this one) onto the stack
            # then jump to the address of f's first instruction
            # equal to:
            #    push eip
            #    jmp f
    mov eax, 0    # go back here after called f
    
    # in callee
    push ebp      # save caller's frame pointer
    mov ebp, esp  # establish callee's frame pointer
    leave         # unwind stack
                  # and restore caller's frame pointer
                  # equal to:
                  #     mov esp, ebp
                  #     pop ebp
    ret           # pop the return address back to eip
